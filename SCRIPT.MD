Home page:

* On the home page, you'll see live stats for the marketplace
* Down here, you can see a listing of all functions currently available in the marketplace.
* Let's say I want to find a function that will give me the current price of Bitcoin in USD.
* Let's see what's available for the "Price Feed" category.
* (Long) Here we can see that there are 3 functions available for the "Price Feed" category, showing different functions
  that I can use to get the price of BTC. Let's go with CoinGecko for this demo since it has the cheapest fee.
* If I want to get up and running right away, I can click on the copy button over here to the right to get a fully
  functional snippet that I can paste into my contract.
* If I want to learn more about the function, or if I want to tweak the snippet, I can click on the function name to
  view more details.

Drilldown:

* In the drilldown, I can see the function name, the fee, the description, and other details about the function. I can
  also see a real time string of all calls made to this function, (pause), and I can also see the full snippet.
* Let's say I want to optimize for the lowest gas price possible. I can click on the "Customize" button
* If I just want a preview, I can click the "Try it now" button for a one time call in the browser without having to
  deploy a contract.

Owner dashboard:

* Now lets say I want to sell my web2 data on the marketplace. To do that, I'll click

By the way, everything shown in the demo is real and running against the Chainlink Functions contracts
